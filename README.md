Hey! Master Readme here. My sibling Readmes will tell you I'm pretty new to this whole github thing. So bare with me here as I struggle though like the noob I am. Going to open this ps1 script to the public via Reddit soon. Guess I'll find out how thats going to go.... Anyways, thanks for stopping by. I'll clean up this repository and make it as presentable as I can over time. You are my guests after all!

*Edit

So yea, I just updated my reddit link and figured I should make a note over here as well. Just in case you guys had saved the link or something. Anyways, this project is put on hold indefinitely so long as I'm not working on STIGs. I have a new job and stuff that does not require me to figure this out any more so thank god for that. Bleh. Anyways, if you want to reach out to me, I reccommend you swing by my reddit profile and shoot me a message directly. Would be the best way to reach me for whatever. Later all!
